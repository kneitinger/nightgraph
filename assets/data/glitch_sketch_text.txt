So you don't
wake up quite
yet, you go on
dreaming of
thirst: your
dry dreams.
The cycle
concludes and
you are fast
asleep,
drifing in
deserts of
sleep where
the sun makes
your head
hurt and then
because there
is no one in
the room to
see you do it
(not  even
your own self)
you vanish
again - the
sheets settling
into the shape
of where your
body is missing
