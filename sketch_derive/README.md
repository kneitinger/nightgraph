# nightsketch_derive
Attribute macros for [nightsketch](../sketch) sketches

## Overview
This crate (currently) provides the `#[sketch]` and `#[param]` attributes
that are used by `nightsketch` sketches to generate `clap` options, field
accessors, parameter metadata, and other implementation details.

The macros in this crate are currently **not** stable, and therefore, this
documentation is not yet populated.  In the future, this will outline the
attribute arguments, and give an overview of the code generated by each
attribute.  In the meantime, one can read the `quote!` macros in this crate's
source if interested.
